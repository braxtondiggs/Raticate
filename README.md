Introducing RedditTV - millions of videos in thousands of subreddits and just one app to watch them all. 

RedditTV puts the videos of Reddit at your fingertips - turn any subreddit into your personal channel and watch new content submitted as it gets upvoted. RedditTV is your source of original, stress-free videos from any subreddit. User-curated videos streamed back-to-back in an app that puts /r/videos to shame.

Everyone hates endlessly clicking on links to get to the videos they want to watch. That’s why we created RedditTV - turning any subreddit into a back-to-back TV channel, streamed directly to your mobile device. 

Turn a subreddit into a TV channel with a tap - then, any video hosted on Vimeo or YouTube can be played from your fingertips. Swipe left or right to skip a video, and say goodbye to repeated trash TV with the power of Reddit. 

RedditTV is perfect for any redditor, doge or bad luck brian - it’s an app that will simply make you say: Wow. Watch hundreds of videos endlessly and stay connected to the expanse of Reddit whilst you sit back and relax. 

From the interesting to the odd, from the wicked to the wonderful - thousands of videos are available to watch instantly - they are just a tap away.

RedditTV - the videos of reddit, curated in a personal channel, streamed directly to you.
